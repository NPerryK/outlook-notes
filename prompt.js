/*
 * CDF Updater - prompt for Claude (claude.ai subscription)
 * Builds the text that goes to Claude with the PDFs - pasted into a chat, or saved once as the
 * instructions of a Claude Project: the instructions from ai-prompt.txt + a strict JSON output
 * format that the task pane can read back.
 *
 * Every prompt carries a short version code (a fingerprint of its text). Claude copies it into
 * each answer, so the pane can tell when a reply was made with older project instructions.
